What Pete had to say : 

"Can I use your textures in my Quake3 map?"

-- sure, everyone is more than welcome to use any and all of my textures and shaders in projects
 for any game as long as the project is not being sold. If you do use any of my textures I would 
appreciate a link to my web site and proper credite given in any text files or documentation 
included with your project.

Thanks,

Conversion info: textures are not downsized, because they`d look crap.
I only made two 32x32 lamps.
Shaders were combined to make light and animated textures.
Be carefull not to overcome 2mb texture data limit of q1.
